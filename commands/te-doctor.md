You are orchestrating Tool Executor diagnostics with clear reporting at each step.

## Arguments

- `test` → Run `npm test` and report results (43 tests expected)
- `health` → Check build status, registry integrity, workspace state
- `reset` → Guide through full reset (clean + reinstall + rebuild)
- `--verbose` → Show detailed output for any mode
- No argument → Run quick health check (build + test)

## Workflow

1. Load the te-doctor skill for methodology
2. Run the requested diagnostic mode
3. Parse and present results clearly
4. Provide actionable next steps based on findings

| Check           | Command                 | Expected         |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Build current   | `npm run build`         | Exit 0           |
| Tests pass      | `npm test`              | 43 passing       |
| Registry valid  | Check `registry/*.json` | Valid JSON       |
| Workspace clean | Check `./workspace/`    | Exists, writable |

## Critical Facts

- **43 tests** - Unit tests for workspace, clients, search; integration tests for execute_code
- **Build required** - Always run `npm run build` after code changes
- **Serena health** - Two instances must be running for full functionality
